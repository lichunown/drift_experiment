Installation
============

To install torchdrift, you may either use the repository

    https://github.com/torchdrift/torchdrift/

and `setup.py` from there or use

::

   pip install torchdrift


to get the latest release and

::

   pip install git+https://github.com/torchdrift/torchdrift/

to install the development version.

Note that `TorchdDrift` is still under rapid development, we expect to break API
compatibility in the versions before 1.0 when we find that usability
benefits from slightly reorganizing things.
